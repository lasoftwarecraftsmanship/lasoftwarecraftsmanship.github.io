    <strong>Craftsmanship Roundtable @ 8th Light Downtown Los Angeles </strong> - July 12 &amp; 7:00 p.m. Let's get together and talk about craftsmanship in a roundtable format (pizza included this time). We can discuss anything you want to -- clean code, what craftsmanship means to you, what's working at your shop (or what's not), practices like TDD, code reviews (bring your own, even), engineering culture, whatever you want as long as it's craftsmanship related. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/LA-Software-Craftsmanship/events/231709119/">RSVP on Meetup</a>
