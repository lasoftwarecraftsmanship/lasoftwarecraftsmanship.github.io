    <strong>Community Code Review</strong> - the super tiny compiler (js), Tuesday, April 26 at 7:00 p.m. Los Angeles time. Let's get together virtually and do another COMMUNITY CODE REVIEW. Turns out that compilers don't need to be scary. Let's hangout and talk about the code, the craftsmanship, and what else is going on with you all. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/LA-Software-Craftsmanship/events/230050924/">RSVP on Meetup</a>
