Thanks for stopping by. We've updated the site to use Github pages and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and all that.

We're just in the beginning, so please consider contributing and sending us your pull requests! [lasoftwarecraftsmanship.github.io](https://github.com/lasoftwarecraftsmanship/lasoftwarecraftsmanship.github.io).
