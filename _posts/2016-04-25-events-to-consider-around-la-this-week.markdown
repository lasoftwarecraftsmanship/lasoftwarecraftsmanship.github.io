Hey Craftspeople -- Here's a quick run down of the events that you might be interested in this week in **Los Angeles**!

The [DevTalk LA](http://www.meetup.com/lajugstudygroup/) community has been doing a series of meetups on that classic book *Code Complete* by Steve McConnell, which was my own start to craftsmanship (though I didn't call it that) years and years ago. Looks like they've been taking the book down, chapter by chapter. Tuesday @ 7:30. Culver City <i class="fa fa-taxi" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Tuesday night is Chapter 8](http://www.meetup.com/lajugstudygroup/events/228708204/)

[Uncoded](http://www.uncoded.org/) has a fun looking volunteer opportunity to go spread some the benefits of craftsmanship as you participate in some non-profit/community coding. Thursday @ 6:30. Long Beach area. <i class="fa fa-taxi" aria-hidden="true"></i> **[BarnRaising!](http://www.uncoded.org/barn-raising/)**

**Sponsored post ;-)** If you can't make DevTalk's *Code Complete* talk, join us, the [LA Software Craftsmanship](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Software-Craftsmanship/) community on Google Hangouts for another **COMMUNITY CODE REVIEW**. Turns out compilers don't have to be scary. Let's dive into THE SUPER TINY COMPILER and talk about craftsmanship in another code review. Tuesday @ 7:00. Google Hangouts. <i class="fa fa-television" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Community Code Review - the super tiny compiler (js)](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Software-Craftsmanship/events/230050924/) * BTW, this isn't really sponsored -- you get it, right?

The [LA Chat Bot Meetup's](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Chat-Bot-Meetup/) first inaugural meetup in the Arts District. They're [going to be talking bots...?](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Chat-Bot-Meetup/events/230031169/) Wish I could go! Tuesday @ 7:00. Arts District (Downtown LA). <i class="fa fa-taxi" aria-hidden="true"></i>

*For those visiting us for the first time*, you should know that this is just a rough list of events that seem like they might be interesting to people who are also interested in software craftsmanship in the Los Angeles/SoCal area. I can't vouch for all the groups since I don't know *all* the communities, but they at least look interesting. Your mileage may vary.
